### Exercise 1 - Embark on your first mission
Go to https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ and open the “Mission Catalog”. 
Search for the mission “Getting Started with Discovery Center Missions”. Open it and start the mission. 
You will need to log on to start it.

and follow the instructions on the next card until you have completed all cards.
Congratulations – you have now completed your first mission.



### Exercise 2 – Get started with SAP BTP
Now it is time to prepare SAP Business Technology Platform and use it.

Again go to https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ and open the “Mission Catalog”. 

Search for the mission “Getting Started with SAP BTP Enterprise Account”. Open and start the mission. 
Again, go through the cards of the project board ad follow the instructions until you have completed the mission. 


### Exercise 3 – Pick your next mission
After you learned how to use the SAP Discovery Center and got started with SAP BTP enterprise accounts it is time to pick your own mission.

There are typical 2 ways which we observed how innovation is being driven:
a)	use case centered,
b)	technology driven.

Please explore both ways by 
a)	browse the Mission Catalog and try the various filter and search options to find your next mission
b)	browse the Service Catalog to explore the technical services SAP BTP offers. Try the various filter and search options to find one or more services. Check the “Related Missions” to find your next mission.

Hint: an interesting category four you could be: “Try for free” in the mission catalog:

These missions can be run without any extra costs as they require only free tier or trial services. 


### Exercise 4 – Give Feedback
The better we at SAP understand your needs the better we can help you. Therefore, we highly appreciate any feedback you give us.

In the SAP Discovery Center you have multiple options to give feedback. Please use them. In case you did not yet stumble upon any option to give feedback here is one more. In the header in the right corner you find:
